Scorpion - the small siren with the big sting! The 3932 model is a 100 watt siren with PA, and a whole lot more. Siren tone selection is made at the touch of a button. Scroll between Wail, Yelp, and HyperYelp without losing the ability to choose the tone you want, when you want it. The Scorpion offers a separate function button for air horn. The Instant On feature allows the siren to remain ready for operation instantly without turning knobs.

The Park Kill feature deactivates the siren when the vehicle is shifted into park. Backlighting is independent of siren power so that is adjustable by connecting a dimmer switch (customer supplied). This option allows the user to use the horn ring the select the siren tone rather than having to hit the sirens buttons. Also included is a separate switch that operates the Radio Rebroadcast feature. The Scorpion has a small profile measuring 6 3/4" wide x 6 3/4" deep x 2 1/4" high.
