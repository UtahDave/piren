You can lose valuable time in a pursuit when you’re trying to work with the controls. That’s why Code 3® designed the MasterCom™ Siren specifically for the vehicles of public safety professionals. Meets all Class A sound level output requirements. A built-in independent six-switch illuminated panel doubles in light intensity when engaged. This siren also features park kill for lighting and siren, and a push-to-talk override.
