Feniex is a team of 50+ enthusiastic, hard-working individuals who collaborate to make the best visual and audio warning products. Our mission is simple: to save lives by designing the most innovative warning systems.

Starting from humble beginnings in 2010, the genesis of Feniex were clustered with challenges. Initially hiring contract engineers and outside manufacturers, we quickly learned that taking shortcuts came with damaging consequences. Since then, we invested in getting the best and brightest engineers along with an amazing crew of assemblers, ensuring that every product that leaves our doors is of the highest quality. Feniex is proud to be the fastest growing emergency vehicle lighting company and we lead the charge in making our products right here in the USA.
